# Introduction to Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity, what a fancy name! But ... what exactly does that mean?

## Introduction

Have you ever being told that your computer contains virus? Or read about personal data breach cases in the news? Maybe watched a movie about spies trying to activate
a nuclear by hijacking the system? Oh! You might have been a victim of phishing scams before.

No? Are you sure? Then how about you type your email address or phone number [here](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) and check whether you have been a victim of data breach before.

Lots of the things we have mentioned before are examples of crimes related to cybersecurity. You might be wondering how your computer virus works exactly.
Well, it is a lot similar to how viruses in real life work. Viruses spread and infect healthy cells by injecting their genetic material and using those cells to replicate.
Imagine a computer virus as an executable program that you can install inside your hardware. Upon installing, it can cause harm to your computer. But ... who in their right
mind will install a virus in the first place? Oh well, they are very creative about that. Usually these viruses are disguised as security updates, so users are pressured
to install.
