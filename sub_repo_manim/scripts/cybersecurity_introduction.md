# Introduction to Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity, what a fancy name! But ... what exactly does that mean?

## Introduction

Have you ever being told that your computer contains virus? Or read about personal data breach cases in the news? Maybe watched a movie about spies trying to activate
a nuclear by hijacking the system? Oh! You might have been a victim of phishing scams before.

No? Are you sure? Then how about you type your email address or phone number [here](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) and check whether you have been a victim of data breach before.

Lots of the things we have mentioned before are examples of crimes related to cybersecurity. You might be wondering how your computer virus works exactly.
Well, it is a lot similar to how viruses in real life work. Viruses spread and infect healthy cells by injecting their genetic material and using those cells to replicate.

Imagine a computer virus as an executable program that you can install inside your hardware. Upon installing, it can cause harm to your computer. But ... who in their right mind will install a virus in the first place? Oh well, they are very creative about that. 
Usually these viruses are disguised as security updates, so users are pressured to install, otherwise their computers are threatened to be vulnerable.
Other times, it could be that your computer truly has a vulnerability, so the attacker can install the virus directly without needing your permission!

By the way, look at that! Vulnerability, another fancy name huh. Don't worry, we'll talk more about it in one sec.

## Vulnerability

Simply put, it is a weakness. 

Since almost programs and systems nowadays are written by programmers (which are humans!), it is inevitable that there could be a flaw in their design. For example, imagine you are a house owner trying to lock your door by using a metal key. You might think that your house is safe from any potential robbers or weird-looking clowns. What you don't know, is that there is an *attacker* who has been following you to the locksmith and managed to get a sample of your key model! Now the attacker can create his own key and breach into your house.
