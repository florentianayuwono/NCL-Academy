# Introduction to Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity, what a fancy name! But ... what exactly does that mean?

## Introduction

Have you ever being told that your computer contains virus? Or read about personal data breach cases in the news? Maybe watched a movie about spies trying to activate
a nuclear by hijacking the system? Oh! You might have been a victim of phishing scams before.

No? Are you sure? Then how about you type your email address or phone number [here](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) and check whether you have been a victim of data breach before.

## Virus

Lots of the things we have mentioned before are examples of crimes related to cybersecurity. You might be wondering how your computer virus works exactly.
Well, it is a lot similar to how viruses in real life work. Viruses spread and infect healthy cells by injecting their genetic material and using those cells to replicate.

Imagine a computer virus as an executable program that you can install inside your hardware. Upon installing, it can cause harm to your computer. But ... who in their right mind will install a virus in the first place? Oh well, they are very creative about that. 
Usually these viruses are disguised as security updates, so users are pressured to install, otherwise their computers are threatened to be vulnerable.
Other times, it could be that your computer truly has a vulnerability, so the attacker can install the virus directly without needing your permission!

By the way, look at that! Vulnerability, another fancy name huh. Don't worry, we'll talk more about it in one sec.

## Vulnerability

Simply put, it is a weakness. 

Since almost programs and systems nowadays are written by programmers (who are humans!), it is inevitable that there could be a flaw in their design. For example, imagine you are a house owner trying to lock your door by using a metal key. You might think that your house is safe from any potential robbers or weird-looking clowns. What you don't know, is that there is an *attacker* who has been following you to the locksmith and managed to get a sample of your key model! Now the attacker can create his own key and breach into your house.

Therefore, these attackers usually look for vulnerabilities or weakness that are present in our system and then use it as a way to go inside and do their illegal stuff. But don't worry, just like the smart home owner who switches to password-based key after the incident, we are also trying to learn and strengthen our security system. Aha! That's where learning cybersecurity comes in handy.

Now that you understand about vulnerability, let's go back to our fun discussion about cyber crimes, shall we?

One way vulnerabilities could be exploitated is by using them to install viruses and take over computers to create sort of computer Avengers to attack and take down other things. Like websites, for example. This practice is commonly referred as denial-of-service.

Oop, another fancy name there. As always, we got you covered!

## Denial-of-Service

Just like a hardworking person you are, being tasked with two to five favours wouldn't really bother you. But imagine the tasks kept coming. It did not stop! You were overwhelmed, and ... and ... you fainted. Websites, are a bit similar to the hardworking person. It can handle and respond to many requests (up to millions) a day, but if the requests keep coming, reaching billions, trillions and what-nots, surely the website will also faint in distress. It stops responding and aha! It becomes vulnerable. Attackers can easily bypass the fainted security guards and continue doing their illegal stuff there. Scary huh.

Does this denial-of-service thing only happen to websites? Of course not! It can happen to people too, unfortunately.

## Phishing Scam

The virus-induced computer Avengers can also send emails to people, mimicking your bank account officer or even Netflix subscription notification. Usually they ask you to click on a link and login your credentials so that they could **save** you from attackers trying to steal your money. As an innocent human being who is afraid of losing money, of course you immediately follow their so-called kindness warnings. Next thing you know, they use your actual information to withdraw your money from the bank. Now that is the real losing money experience.

You have suffered a phishing scam. You are traumatized. What should you do now? Learn from the experience! Don't believe the security updates or suspicious emails telling you to click on the link or install something easily. Always check and confirm, a simple Google query might help you save a million dollars!

## Summary

Phew! That's a lot. We have discussed so many things today. From cybersecurity, virus, denial-of-service, oh don't forget the evil computer Avengers! Phishing scam ... what else? Is that everything? Nope! There is still so many things more! Topics covered today are easily recognized by your everyday life, but aren't you interested to the blank and white screens, with red lights and yellow warnings coming from the cool hackers trying to hijack CIA database thingy you saw in the movie?

Well, if you are up to the nitty-gritty of cybersecurity, don't forget to watch the upcoming videos! We will get our hands dirty with **spoiler** fancy names like log4shell, spring4shell and many more! Now, that sounds more like it, doesn't it?
